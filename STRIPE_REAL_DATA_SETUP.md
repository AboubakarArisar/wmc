# How to Get Real Stripe Data (No Server Required)

## Current Status
✅ Firebase data is working (real data from your database)
❌ Stripe data is currently showing simulated data

## To Get Real Stripe Data:

### Option 1: Manual Update (Easiest)
1. Go to your Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/
2. Check your actual metrics:
   - Total Revenue (last 30 days)
   - Number of Orders
   - Number of Sessions
   - Average Order Value
3. Update the values in `src/index.html` around line 300:
   ```javascript
   const stripeData = {
       totalRevenue: 12450.75,  // Replace with your actual revenue
       newOrders: 127,          // Replace with your actual order count
       sessions: 89,            // Replace with your actual session count
       averageOrderValue: 98.03 // Replace with your actual AOV
   };
   ```

### Option 2: Use Stripe Webhooks (Advanced)
If you want automatic updates, you can:
1. Set up Stripe webhooks to send data to Firebase
2. Read the data from Firebase (like documents)
3. This requires some backend setup

### Option 3: Stripe API with CORS Proxy (Not Recommended)
- Would require external service
- Not recommended for production

## Current Dashboard Shows:
- ✅ Real Firebase data (documents, orders, customers, etc.)
- ✅ Working charts and tables
- ❌ Simulated Stripe data (easy to update manually)

## Quick Fix:
Just update the 4 numbers in the JavaScript code with your real Stripe metrics!
