# Project Overview

- Date: 2025-10-01

## Vision
A modular admin-dashboard style frontend, built from `src/` and output to `dist/`, with Gulp 4 build pipeline, live reload, and example integrations (Stripe, Firebase).

## Objectives
- Provide a clean starter with many UI pages and assets
- Simple build: compile SCSS, bundle assets, process HTML includes
- Ensure CSS compatibility and minification by default

## Problems Solved
- Fast static site iteration with partials and live reload
- Consistent CSS processing with autoprefixing and minification
- Ready-to-use examples for common web integrations
